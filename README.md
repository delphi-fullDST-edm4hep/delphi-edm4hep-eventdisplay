# DELPHI event display — edm4hep → Plotly

One DELPHI event drawn straight from an edm4hep file: no DELGRA, no X11, no ROOT, no key4hep.
A Python port of the matplotlib display written for the Sept 2026 talk, rebuilt on Plotly so the
figure zooms, hovers and can be edited in a browser.

**Live:** https://delphi-fulldst-edm4hep.github.io/delphi-edm4hep-eventdisplay/ — the landing page, the
[display](https://delphi-fulldst-edm4hep.github.io/delphi-edm4hep-eventdisplay/app.html) and the
[manual](https://delphi-fulldst-edm4hep.github.io/delphi-edm4hep-eventdisplay/manual/).
A temporary copy is mirrored at <https://sqian.web.cern.ch/delphi-edm4hep-eventdisplay/>.

The display opens on a published showcase event, and you can drop **any**
edm4hep file on it to step through that file's events instead — read in the browser with uproot
under Pyodide, so nothing is uploaded. Beside the figure is every collection in the event with its
type, domain, provenance, links and per-event counts; selecting one dims everything in the figure
that did not come from it, and clicking a track selects its collection. Switch between the four
panels and a 3-D detector scene, and save either as PNG, SVG or figure JSON.

## Install and run

```bash
pip install -e .
delphi-display FILE.edm4hep.root --entry 3990 --out docs/events/my_event.html \
    --require-vd --rich 20,22,21 \
    --group 'φ → K⁺K⁻ (both kaons RICH-identified):#d62728:20,22'
delphi-pages      # rebuild docs/events/index.json so the site lists the new event
docs/build.sh     # rebuild the wheel the browser app installs (CI fails if it is stale)
```

Each run writes two files: a **self-contained `.html`** (plotly.js inlined, ~5 MB, opens offline)
and a **`.json`** figure (~0.5 MB) — the JSON is what the site and the editor load, and the only
one committed. `examples/make_events.sh` holds the exact commands for the two talk events.

Options mirror the matplotlib original: `--title`, `--note`, `--group 'label:colour:i,j,k'`
(repeatable), `--rich i,j,...`, `--fit-vertex i,j`, `--require-vd`, `--max-ip MM`, `--jets`,
`--width/--height`, `--cdn`. Track indices come from the original `dump_event.py --run --event`
(data) or `mc_dump_event.py --entry` (simulation).

## Any file, any collection

Nothing is pinned by name. The collections are discovered from the file's own podio metadata --
the same source the converter's [collection map](https://delphi-fulldst-edm4hep.github.io/delphi-edm4hep/collection_map.html)
is built from -- and each part of the display is bound to one of them by *role*:

```bash
delphi-display FILE.edm4hep.root --entry 3990 --list-collections   # what is in this file
delphi-display FILE.edm4hep.root --entry 3990 --out e.html     --collection vd_hits=sDST_TDVD_VDPoints     --collection secondary_vertices=sDST_V0_V0Candidates
```

Roles: `particles`, `tracks`, `jets`, `primary_vertex`, `secondary_vertices`, `em_clusters`,
`vd_hits`, `hadron_id`. Each resolves to the first collection of the right EDM4hep type matching
its preference list (`schema.ROLES`), so the usual DELPHI names stay the defaults. This matters
because a file offers far more than one of each: the 1994 data file carries 3 `Track` collections,
7 `Vertex`, 4 `Cluster`, 2 `TrackerHit3D` and 24 `ParticleID`.

In the browser app the same choice is a set of dropdowns, beside a panel listing every collection
with its per-event count, domain, provenance and links. Selecting a collection dims everything in
the figure that did not come from it; clicking a track or hit selects its collection. Every trace
carries `meta.collection`, which is what wires the two together.

## What it draws

Four panels, all from measured quantities only:

* **(a) r-φ** whole event: track helices, EM showers (tower length ∝ energy), the HPC radius taken
  from the shower positions.
* **(b) r-z**: the same tracks, r signed by thrust hemisphere.
* **(c) vertex detector, r-φ**: the three VD layers (radii from the hits themselves), the R-φ hits,
  the primary vertex and the accepted AABTAG secondary vertices. The matplotlib version needed a
  fixed inset for the vertex region; here you zoom with the mouse.
* **(d) RICH**: Cherenkov angle vs momentum, liquid and gas radiators, with the expected π/K/p
  curves (n_liq 1.2718, n_gas 1.0019; gas thresholds π 2.26 / K 8.0 / p 15.2 GeV). A track above
  the pion threshold with zero gas photons is drawn as a veto marker.

Tracks are helices from the AtIP (perigee) track state. A track belonging to a reconstructed
secondary vertex starts at that vertex, with the back-extrapolation to the IP dotted, so nothing
suggests a path the particle never travelled.

What Plotly adds over the original: hover naming each track (charge, momentum, VD hits, which
vertex it starts from), a legend that switches whole classes of object off, and free zoom.

## Captions, not headings

`--title` and `--note` describe **one event** ("Z → bb̄ with a displaced φ → K⁺K⁻"), so they are
never drawn into the figure and never shown as a heading for the tool -- they are stored in
`layout.meta` and rendered by the page as a trailing caption. Everything true of any event (run,
event, source, charged/neutral, b-tag, B field) is rendered live from the same metadata. The
figures themselves carry no text that would go stale on the next event, except the embedded
DELPHI + EDM4hep mark (`_logo.py`, a data URI, so it survives PNG/SVG export and offline HTML).

The browser app saves the current view as **PNG**, **SVG** or the **figure JSON**, named after the
run and event.

## Layout

| | |
|---|---|
| `src/delphi_eventdisplay/read.py` | edm4hep → an `Event`: the collection names and every decoding rule |
| `src/delphi_eventdisplay/geometry.py` | helices, the curvature-sign check, where each track starts, the self-checks |
| `src/delphi_eventdisplay/figure.py` | the four panels → one `go.Figure` |
| `src/delphi_eventdisplay/cli.py` | `delphi-display` |
| `src/delphi_eventdisplay/pages.py` | `delphi-pages`, rebuilds the site manifest |
| `src/delphi_eventdisplay/schema.py` | collection discovery from podio metadata; roles, counts, links |
| `docs/` | the published site: `index.html` landing, `app.html` the display, `editor.html`, `events/*.json`, `wheels/` the wheel the app installs |
| `doc/` | manual sources; `mkdocs build` renders them into `docs/manual/` |
| `docs/build.sh` | rebuilds the wheel the browser app installs |

## Self-checks printed on every run

The display re-derives rather than hard-codes the things that have moved between converter
versions, and prints what it found. On the 1994 data event (run 48758, event 2666):

```
curvature check on 4 track-cluster links: median miss 15 mm (omega as stored) vs 613 mm (flipped) -> sign +1
VD hit decoding check: r-phi hits vs own track |d(R*phi)| median 3 um (n=47); z hits |dz| median 0.00 mm (n=32)
track start points: 9 at their secondary vertex (miss 10-49 um), 7 at the primary vertex, 3 at their perigee
hidden 3 tracks: 33 (0.49 GeV, 189.5 mm, 0 VD hits: no VD hits), ...
```

A r-φ residual of a few µm is what says the VD strip decoding is right; if it ever reads hundreds
of mm, the decoding below has regressed.

## Things worth knowing before extending it

* **VD hits are strip coordinates, not space points.** In `sDST_TDVD_VDHits`, a type-0 (R-φ) hit
  stores x = layer radius R and z = R·φ; a type-1 (z) hit stores x = −R and z = the measured z.
  Plotting the raw (x, y) puts every hit near φ = 0.
* **Curvature sign** is re-checked per event by extrapolating tracks to their linked calorimeter
  clusters and comparing both signs.
* AABTAG secondary vertices are accepted when their ITSEC parameter is ≥ 0; rejected hypotheses
  are not drawn.
* **Open Plotly marker symbols take their stroke from `marker.color`**, not `marker.line.color` —
  leaving it unset silently tints each vertex a different colour from the default cycle.
* **Branches are read with `library="np"`** (`read._Entry`), not awkward arrays -- one branch at a
  time, cached. `uproot >= 5.7` still imports awkward itself, so it stays a dependency.
* **`tree.keys()` spells branches `parent/parent.field`** while `arrays()` calls them
  `parent.field`. Comparing the two spellings silently finds nothing.
* **`pip wheel repo` installs a package named `repo` from PyPI**, not your directory. Use `./repo`.
* **plotlyhep's template sets `showlegend: False`** (it mirrors mplhep, where you call `legend()`
  yourself), so the figure sets `showlegend=True` explicitly.
* Particle ID: `sDST_XNEWTAG_RichTags` plus the raw HAID angles/photon counts.
  `sDST_RPROCO_CombinedTags` calls ~6% of 3–8 GeV pions that radiate in the gas kaons — don't
  trust it for single-event claims. TPC dE/dx is in `sDST_BBDXGET_Dedx`; it cannot separate p from
  π around 1.7 GeV.

## Data

The edm4hep files are not in this repository. The talk events live on EOS:

```
/eos/experiment/eealliance/Users/zhangj/edm4hepSimBTagging/data_94c/Y13709.126.edm4hep.root   # entry 3990
/eos/experiment/eealliance/Users/zhangj/edm4hepSimBTagging/Zbb/bb_1000182.edm4hep.root        # entry 422
```

They are produced by [delphi-edm4hep](https://github.com/delphi-fullDST-edm4hep/delphi-edm4hep).
